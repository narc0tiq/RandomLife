To actually run the application, you will need to provide the appropriate
libTCOD DLLs or SOs for your system -- they must be in the directory you launch
rl.py from (so, the same directory as rl.py).

These instructions are correct for libTCOD v1.5.1:

On Windows, you will want libtcod-mingw.dll and SDL.dll.

On Linux, you will want libtcod.so and possibly SDLlib.so (however, the latter
may be provided/provideable by your package manager instead).
